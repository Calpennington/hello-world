# hello-world
This repository is for my practice with the GitHub Flow.
I am pursuing a major in finance & business analytics and information systems at The University of Iowa Tippie College of Business.
# Description
This is essentially me working on my ability to use, and get acustomed too github. These are some basic descriptions of some hobbies I partake in,
# Cooking
*Cooking is a creative and rewarding hobby that allows you to experiment with different flavors, ingredients, and cuisines.* Whether trying out new recipes or perfecting a signature dish, it’s a great way to unwind while also nourishing yourself and others. Cooking offers endless opportunities for learning, from mastering knife skills to understanding how various spices and herbs can ***transform*** a meal.
# Running / Going to the Gym
*Running and hitting the gym combine physical fitness with mental clarity.* Running offers a chance to connect with nature, clear your mind, and improve cardiovascular health. Meanwhile, the gym provides a structured environment to build strength, endurance, and flexibility, whether through lifting weights, resistance training, or group classes. Both activities are excellent ways to set personal goals and feel a sense of **achievement**.
# Watching Sports
*Watching sports is more than just entertainment;* it’s a chance to immerse yourself in the energy of competition, teamwork, and athleticism. Whether you’re cheering for a favorite team, following a particular league, or just watching with your friends, sports bring people together. They spark conversations, and offer moments of excitement and drama. It’s a perfect hobby for both socializing and passionate fandom.
